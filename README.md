shooting_blanks
===============

Game from Global Game Jam 2014

In this 2D 2-player top-down shooter, use your army of clones to eliminate the other player's clones. The catch: only one of your clones fires real bullets - the rest fire harmless blanks. The only way to tell who is "real" is to observe the effects of the shooting carefully. If your "real" clone is eliminated, then one of your other clones becomes your real clone.
